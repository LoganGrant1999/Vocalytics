  product_name: "YouTube Comment Assistant"
  codename: "TubeWhisper"
  owner: "Logan Gibbons"
  date_created: "2025-10-07"
  target_launch: "2025-11-01"
  version: "v0.9-MVP"
  stack:
    backend: "Node.js + Fastify (Claude Code scaffold)"
    frontend: "ChatGPT App SDK (for embedded conversational interface)"
    database: "Firestore (lightweight metadata storage)"
    external_apis:
      - "YouTube Data API v3 (read-only: comments.list)"
      - "OpenAI API (GPT-4o-mini / GPT-4-turbo)"
    deployment:
      - "Vercel (frontend)"
      - "Render/Fly.io (backend)"

problem_statement:
  summary: >
    YouTube creators waste significant time moderating, filtering, and replying to
    video comments. Spam, negativity, and sheer comment volume make it hard to
    engage with real fans efficiently.
    The native YouTube Studio comment tools are slow, lack sentiment insight, and
    offer no AI reply assistance — especially for small creators without teams.

  user_pain_points:
    - "Creators spend 30–90 minutes daily responding to comments manually."
    - "YouTube’s default filters miss nuance — many 'spammy' comments are misclassified, while real ones get buried."
    - "Engaging with comments is crucial for audience retention, but it’s mentally exhausting."
    - "Small creators can’t afford social media managers or AI tools like Sprinklr or Hootsuite."
    - "No current solution offers conversational, context-aware moderation and response suggestions in one flow."

  why_now:
    - "ChatGPT App Store is newly launched; early discoverability window (Q4 2025)."
    - "Creators increasingly use AI to streamline workflows but lack in-chat automation tools."
    - "OpenAI SDK + YouTube API integration is feasible with a small team."
    - "Monetization through SaaS subscription aligns with creators’ existing spending patterns ($10–50/mo on TubeBuddy, vidIQ, etc.)."

value_proposition:
  statement: >
    TubeWhisper saves creators hours each week by summarizing, classifying, and
    drafting thoughtful comment replies in seconds — directly inside ChatGPT.

  key_benefits:
    - "Cut comment time by 80% — review all comments in one summarized batch."
    - "Auto-filter spam and negativity — only see high-value engagement."
    - "Generate authentic, tone-matched replies with one click."
    - "Visualize audience sentiment over time."
    - "All conversational — no new dashboard to learn."
